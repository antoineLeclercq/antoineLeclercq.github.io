### About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for learning and solving difficult problems, such as **[building an efficient and scalable Background Job Processor from scratch](https://workerholic.github.io){:target="_blank"}**. I mainly work with Ruby and JavaScript. On my spare time I invest into my hobbies, which include: playing the piano, going by the ocean and ride on waves (whether it’s by surfing, kitesurfing or windsurfing), and, fostering kittens from the ACC (Animal Care Center) until they’re of age of being adopted!

Why Software Engineering you ask? Well, I first became interested in programming while working as a Data Analyst in New York City. I saw the passion of the software engineers at my company and the types of problems they were working on, and realized that this is something I wanted to do. Soon after, I started my journey to become a software engineer. After several years of careful study and deep, intensive learning, I was finally able to complete the transition!

I am a co-creator of Workerholic, an efficient and scalable Background Job Processor written in Ruby ➡ **[Check it out!](https://workerholic.github.io){:target="_blank"}**
