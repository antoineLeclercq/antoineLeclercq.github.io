## *Currently looking for my next opportunity in NYC.*

I am passionate about learning, solving problems, helping the community and Software Engineering. I first got into programming while being a Data Analyst intern for a year in New York City. The Software Engineers I was working with were very talented and managed to communicate their passion to me. I started teaching myself programming with online resources while doing my internship and I developed a passion for it. A passion so strong that I decided to pursue, even after my internship ended in January 2016.

I am co-creator of Workerholic, a Background Job Processor written in Ruby. You can find the project's story **[here](https://workerholic.github.io){:target="_blank"}**.
