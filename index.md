### About Me

I am a software engineer with a passion for learning and solving difficult problems, especially ones that impact the software engineering community. I first became interested in programming while working as a Data Analyst in New York City. I saw the passion with which the software engineers at my company worked and the types of problems they were working on, and realized that this is something I wanted to do. Soon after, I started my journey to become a software engineer myself. After two years full time of careful study and deep learning, I was finally able to complete the transition.

I am co-creator of Workerholic, a Background Job Processor written in Ruby.
