**Workerholic is an efficient and scalable Background Job Processor built from scratch** by myself and my two teammates. This is the story of how three Software Engineers decided to shed some light on Background Job Processors by building one from scratch. We started by understanding the use for a Background Job Processor (BJP), then, identifying the most popular ones in the Ruby-ecosystem and, finally, building one from scratch. In this post we will walk you through the proces of building a BJP from scratch and how we managed to build one, Workerholic, that compares to Sidekiq in terms of performance.
